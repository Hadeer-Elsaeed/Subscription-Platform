## API Endpoints

### 1- Subscribe to a Website

```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/websites/{website_id}/subscribe

body
{
    "user_id" : 1
}
```

### 2- Create a Post for a Website

```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/websites/{website_id}/posts

body 
{
    "title" : "post1",
    "description": "There is the first post to test"
}

### Send Emails to Subscribers
This command checks for all new posts and sends them to subscribers using queued jobs.

```bash
php artisan SendPostsEmails
```

- It will only send posts that havenâ€™t already been sent to a subscriber.

- It uses the Laravel queue system (make sure queue:work is running).

- Emails include post title and description.
